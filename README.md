# Predicting Health Outcomes using Machine Learning

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is developed in alignment with **Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): Good Health and Well-being**. The primary goal is to use machine learning to predict the likelihood of a negative health outcome (e.g., diabetes) based on patient medical and demographic data.

By enabling early detection, this solution can assist healthcare professionals and digital health systems in identifying at-risk individuals and delivering timely interventions.

## 🎯 SDG Target
- **SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being**
- Focus Area: Early disease detection and prevention using data-driven methods.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- **Model Used**: Random Forest Classifier (Supervised Learning)
- **Preprocessing**: 
  - Encoding categorical features
  - Filling missing values with forward-fill
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Publicly available (e.g., Kaggle or UCI repository)
- **Features**: Glucose, BMI, Age, Blood Pressure, etc.
- **Target**: `Outcome` (1 = disease present, 0 = not present)
- **Preprocessing Tool**: `pandas`

---

## 📈 Results
- Accuracy: 1.0
- Confusion matrix analysis showed reliable classification with minimal misclassification.

---

## 🔍 Ethical Considerations
- Possible demographic bias in the dataset
- Importance of fairness and data privacy in healthcare predictions
- Model is a prototype and not a substitute for medical diagnosis
